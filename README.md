 ## <h1>üí°What is Flutter</h1>

<p align="justify">
  Flutter is an open-source UI framework developed by Google for building natively compiled applications across multiple platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop. It allows developers to use a single codebase to create visually appealing and high-performance applications that can run on different operating systems.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Flutter utilizes Dart as its programming language and provides a rich set of customizable widgets that enable developers to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces. With its hot reload feature, developers can make real-time changes to the code and see the updates instantly, enhancing productivity and accelerating the development process.

## üìñ Description
<p align="justify">
My project is a flutter application through which one can observe pictures of the planets and some of their moons in the solar system. Planets are ordered by how close they are to the sun, excluding moons. You can see the names of the planets and moons in three different languages - Bulgarian, English and German.
